## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of version 0.1.2. In this version, I have added examples to each of the functions in the package. 

I did get a note from win_build:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Keith Goldfeld <Keith.Goldfeld@nyumc.org>'

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  MCAR (16:17)
  Missingness (15:24)
  NMAR (16:28)
  covariates (12:27)
  
These are all spelled correctly.
