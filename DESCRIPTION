Description: A collection of functions that allow users to generate simulated
    data sets in order to explore modeling techniques or better understand data
    generating processes. The user specifies a set of relationships between
    covariates, and generates data based on these specifications. The final data
    sets can represent data from randomized control trials, repeated measure
    (longitudinal) designs, and cluster randomized trials. Missingness can be
    generated using various mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, NMAR).
